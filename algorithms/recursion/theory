recursion == is a programming and mathematical concept where a
function calls itself to solve a problem , breaking it into
smaller , identical problems until a simple "base case"
is met , stopping the process


steps to solve a problem using recursion

1) define the base case
2) define the recursive case  -- with lesser input
3) ensure the recursion terminates


How to identify that it is a recursion based question

1) Look for "all possible ways" or "generate"
2) check if it can be broken into smaller similar problems
          - factorial,fibonacci,factorial
3) identify decisions at each step
          - include/exclude  or move left/right/down/up
4) check for structure like decision tress.....
