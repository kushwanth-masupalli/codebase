# a loop  is repeating the same action 
# in python a for loop is more than a traitor 
# syntax:
#  for variable in sequence:
#      statement
#a=[1,2,3,4,8,8,8,7,9,66]
#for i in a: 
# print(i)
name ='kushwanth'
for i in name :
 print(i)
 if i=='h':
  break
print("hello king")
numbers=[1,2,3,4,5]
square=[]
for i in numbers:
 squares=i**2
 square.append(squares)   # this is used to add things into the list
print(square)
