Wrapper classes are object representations of Java's primitive types.

Primitive Type	Wrapper Class
byte	     Byte
short	    Short
int 	    Integer
long	    Long
float	    Float
double	    Double
char	    Character
boolean 	Boolean

✅ Purpose:
To treat primitive values as objects.

Useful in collections (like ArrayList, HashMap) which require objects, not primitives.

Helpful for utility methods (e.g., Integer.parseInt()).
